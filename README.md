# lein-git-version

I'm a big fan of DRY.  I already have version information in git for
my projects.  Remembering to maintain that information in my
project.clj is a PITA.  So... Here's a Leiningen plugin to obtain a
version identifier from git, using:

    git describe --match 'v*.*' --abbrev=4 --dirty=**DIRTY**

It uses annotated git tags (those set with `git tag -a`) as the
authoritative source of version information for your project.

It then substitutes that version into the project on the fly, so every
lein task that uses the project version sees the one obtained from
git.

In addition, it injects a file into <project>/src/<project>/version.clj, containing a def for the version.

## Usage

Put `[org.clojars.cvillecsteele/lein-git-version "1.0.0"]` into the `:plugins` vector
of your project.clj.

That's it.  The version string set in your project.clj will be
ignored, and all lein tasks relying on it will instead see the
git-ified version.

For example, with a project.clj that looks like this:

    (defproject nifty "bLAH BLaH"
      :description "Do nifty things"
      ...)

You can do this:      

    $ git tag -a -m "First version!" v1.0.0
    $ lein git-version
    1.0.0
    $ lein jar
    Created /Users/colinsteele/Projects/nifty/target/nifty-1.0.0.jar
    $ cat src/nifty/version.clj
    ;; Do not edit.  Generated by lein-git-version plugin
    (ns nifty.version)
    (def version "1.0.0")
    $

## Configuration

If you have your own version tagging scheme, and/or some other way of
grabbing a version string from your source tree, you can configure
lein-git-version by adding keys to the :git-version hash-map in your
project.

The following are the defaults:

    (defproject nifty "bLAH BLaH"
      ...
      :git-version {:describe-command ["git" "describe" "--match" 
                                       "v*.*" "--abbrev=4"
                                       "--dirty=**DIRTY**"]
                    :tag->version (fn [tag] (apply str (rest tag)))})
    
`describe-command` is a shell command that should print the current
tag, and `tag->version` is a function that translates the tag into a
version string.
